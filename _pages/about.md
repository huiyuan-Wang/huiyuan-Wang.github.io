This is Dr. Huiyuan Wang's home on the web!

I am a postdoc researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Peking University in 2023 under the supervision of Professor Wei Lin. My research interests mainly focus on causal inference, explainable AI, data fusion, and heterogenous federated learning. I am also interested in the learning theory of large-scale machine learning models, such as deep neural networks and tree-based models.
