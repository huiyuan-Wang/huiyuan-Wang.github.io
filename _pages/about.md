Welcome to my personal website! I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. I will be co-advised by Professor [Yong Chen](https://penncil.med.upenn.edu/about-pi/) and Professor [Yang Ning](https://yangning.stat.cornell.edu/). 

Recently, I successfully defended my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Peking University in May, 2023 under the supervision of Professor [Wei Lin](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/linw/).

My résumé can be [downloaded here](https://huiyuan-wang.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
I have three main research interests: (i) statistical foundations of machine learning, with emphases on overparametrization, self-supervision, and interpretation, (ii) integration of multiple potentially heterogeneous data sources, and (iii) estimation and inference for graphical models of complex data. 

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in learning more about my research! [Email](mailto:Huiyuan.Wang@Pennmedicine.upenn.edu): huiyuan(dot)wang(at)pennmedicine(dot)upenn(dot)edu
