This is Dr. Huiyuan Wang's home on the web!

I am a postdoc researcher advised by Professor [Yong Chen](https://penncil.med.upenn.edu/about-pi/) at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Peking University in July, 2023 under the supervision of Professor [Wei Lin](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/linw/). 

I have three main research interests: (i) statistical foundations of machine learning, with emphases on overparametrization, self-supervision, and interpretation, (ii) integration of multiple potentially heterogeneous data sources, and (iii) estimation and inference for graphical models of complex data.
